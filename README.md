# Monolith vs. Serverless: A Comparative Case Study

## Overview

This project presents a detailed case study comparing Monolith and Serverless architectures. It explores their respective advantages, disadvantages, and suitable use cases. The goal is to provide insights and guidance for developers and architects in choosing the right architecture for their specific needs.

## Project Structure

This repository contains the following files:

- **[case_study.md](case_study.md)**: The main document that presents the comparative analysis between Monolith and Serverless architectures. It includes sections on the background, advantages and disadvantages, use cases, and a general conclusion.
  
- **[examples/monolith_example](examples/monolith_example.png)**: An example project that demonstrates the implementation of a Monolith architecture. This example is useful for understanding the practical aspects of building and deploying a Monolithic application.
  
- **[examples/serverless_example](examples/serverless_example.png)**: An example project that showcases the Serverless architecture. This example illustrates the event-driven approach and how functions can be deployed and scaled automatically.
