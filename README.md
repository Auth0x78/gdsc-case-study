## Introduction

In this case study, we delve into two popular architectural approaches: Monolith and Serverless. We will discuss their definitions, benefits, challenges, and how they fit into various scenarios.

## Background

- **Monolith Architecture**: A traditional approach where an application is built as a single, unified unit. This section provides historical context and common use cases.
- **Serverless Architecture**: A modern approach where applications are composed of functions that are executed in response to events. This section covers the evolution and use cases of serverless computing.

## Monolith Architecture

### Overview

Monolith architecture involves a single, cohesive application. This section discusses:

- **Advantages**: Simplicity, ease of deployment, and centralized management.
- **Disadvantages**: Scalability issues, long deployment cycles, and tight coupling.

### Use Cases

Typical scenarios where Monolith architecture is beneficial include:

- Small to medium-sized applications.
- Projects with simpler requirements.

## Serverless Architecture

### Overview

Serverless architecture involves breaking down applications into discrete functions that are executed in response to events. This section discusses:

- **Advantages**: Scalability, reduced operational overhead, and cost efficiency.
- **Disadvantages**: Cold start issues, vendor lock-in, and complexity in debugging.

### Use Cases

Typical scenarios where Serverless architecture excels include:

- Highly scalable applications.
- Event-driven applications with varying load.

## Comparative Analysis

### Cost Analysis

Compare the cost implications of Monolith vs. Serverless architectures:

- **Monolith**: Infrastructure costs, scaling challenges, and maintenance.
- **Serverless**: Pay-as-you-go model, cost for function executions, and resource utilization.

### Development and Deployment

Analyze the complexity of development and deployment:

- **Monolith**: Single deployment unit, simpler development but potential for large, complex codebases.
- **Serverless**: Decoupled functions, ease of deployment but with complexity in orchestration.

### Performance Metrics

Discuss performance aspects such as:

- **Monolith**: Latency, throughput, and resource usage.
- **Serverless**: Cold start times, execution time, and scalability.

## Conclusion

[TODO]

## Examples

This repository includes example projects for both architectures:

- **[Monolith Example](examples/monolith_example)**: Demonstrates a typical Monolith application.
- **[Serverless Example](examples/serverless_example)**: Demonstrates a typical Serverless application.
