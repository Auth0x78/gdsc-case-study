Monolith vs Serverless: Comparative Case Study

## Abstract

The paper details Monolith and Serverless Architecture through a case-study comparison. It looks inside their pros/cons and ideal use cases. This is meant to detail the one that could easily be used between these two architectures based on the need with insight and knowledge equipped in developers and architects.

## Structure of the Project

The repository contains the following files:

- **[case_study.md](case_study.md)**: The main document presenting the comparative analysis between Monolith and Serverless architectures. It holds a background, advantages and disadvantages, use cases, and general conclusions.
- **[example/monolith_example](example/monolith_example.png]**: Example project using Monolith architecture with explanatory comments.
- **[example/srverless_examplep](example/serverless_example.jpeg)**: Sample project showing the arhitecture of Serverless. Example on how functions could be event-driven, deployed and scaled automatically.
